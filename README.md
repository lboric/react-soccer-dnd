# React Soccer Application


![ReactSoccer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebbf5b05-b596-42b7-ad76-f8be5211f326)

A React.js app featuring an interactive soccer field where players and the ball can be freely moved across a grid-based layout, almost like a tactical chessboard for soccer! Built with React DnD, this project lets you experiment with player positioning, ball movement, and formation setups. Perfect for exploring drag-and-drop interactions in React while playing with soccer strategy.
